A tiny Figma plugin that just creates a Rounded Rectangle (a.k.a squircle).

For the people that are used to Sketch (using the U shortcut to create a Rounded Rectangle).

Once installed, you can you use this trick to create a keyboard shortcut:

I personally recommend Control+U (as CMD+U and Alt+U don't work), but you can set anything you want.
